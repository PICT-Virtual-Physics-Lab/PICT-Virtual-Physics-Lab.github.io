        <h1>Interference of light</h1>
        <pre>
            Interference of light is the phenomena of multiple light waves 
            interacting with one another under certain circumstances, 
            causing the combined amplitudes of the waves to either increase or decrease.

        </pre>
        <h3>Constructive Interference
        </h3>
        <pre> If the crests of one of the waves coincide 
            with the crests of the other, the amplitudes are additive.
            Such additive interference is called <b>constructive interference</b>.

        <h3>Destructive Interference
        </h3>
        <pre>If the crests of one wave coincide with the troughs of the other wave,
            the resulting amplitude is decreased or may even be completely canceled.
            This is called <b>destructive interference</b>.</pre>
